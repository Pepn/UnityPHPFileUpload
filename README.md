 UnityPHPFileUpload
Low-tier PHP File Upload Script, does the job, not that safe, but prob safe enough for small projects.

# Intructions
- Change the password in the getFile.php to somethinge else, and send this password as a header in your http request. (Unsafe!)
- Remove the [REMOVENAME] from the .htacccess file to it works correctly on your server. This prevents the internet access to the uploaded files.
